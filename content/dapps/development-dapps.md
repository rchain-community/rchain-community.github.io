# Build DApps

DApps are a growing oppurtunity for disrupting decentralized applications. With this tutorial you learn to create a wallet and get free testnet tokens.

## Create a wallet

1. To use the rchain network you need to have a wallet. Open this [rnode-client](https://tgrospic.github.io/rnode-client-js/) page from the rchain community. There you can create a new wallet. The code to this wallet is [open-source](https://github.com/tgrospic/rnode-client-js).

2. Change the network to testnet. The testnet is for testing puposes only.

3.  Click on new account and type a name (here Account) in the field. Then click _Save account_.

    > ⚠️ Save your private key, public key, ETH key, REV key somewhere else!

    > ⚠️ Never share your private key with somebody else!

    > ⚠️ The REV key is like an ethereum address you can share.

5. Put your Rev address in the field and submit.

## Use your wallet with metamask

To protect your private key, you can use metamask.

Supported ways:

- Import with your private key
- Connect a hardware wallet

   > ⚠️ If you are in incognito mode in chrome you have to enable the metamask plugin for incognito mode. Otherwise there is no metamask icon shown up on the top right.

2. Click on import account.
