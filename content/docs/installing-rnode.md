# Installing RNode

There are two possibilities to setup a rnode instance and connect to a network for deployment of your smart-contracts:

- Install a non-Docker instance on your computer or
- Install a Docker instance locally

> If you are new and want to start your local rnode instance on your pc with only a few clicks then go with the docker setup.  
> (**recommended way for beginners**): Follow this [tutorial](/dapps/setup-docker/).
